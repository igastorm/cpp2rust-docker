# Boxing

In the refcount model a variable is boxed: its type `T` is wrapped in
`Value<T>`, an alias for `Rc<RefCell<T>>` (see
[Reference Counting](../../runtime/rc.md)). Without the box, taking the address
of a variable would need a Rust reference, and arbitrary C++ aliasing cannot be
expressed with references.

Not every type position is boxed. `ConverterRefCount` keeps a stack of
conversion kinds, [`conversion_kind_`](../internals/state.md), and the construct
that owns the type pushes one before printing it:

- `FullRefCount`: pushed by variable declarations; `Convert(QualType)` wraps the
  result in `Value<...>`.
- `Pointee`: pushed by field declarations; the bare type is printed. Fields that
  are arrays, or whose type maps to a `Vec` or a `Box` (`std::vector`,
  `std::string`, `std::array`), push `FullRefCount` instead (see below).
- `Unboxed`: pushed by parameter lists, return types, and record names; the bare
  type is printed.
- `Ptr`: pushed by a pointer type for its pointee; also printed bare.

The result by position:

| Position                                    | `int`        | `Item`        | `int[3]`             |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------------- |
| local variable, global                      | `Value<i32>` | `Value<Item>` | `Value<Box<[i32]>>`  |
| function parameter, return type             | `i32`        | `Item`        | decays to `Ptr<i32>` |
| struct field                                | `i32`        | `Item`        | `Value<Box<[i32]>>`  |
| pointee of `Ptr<T>`, element of a container | `i32`        | `Item`        | `Box<[i32]>`         |

Parameters arrive unboxed and are re-boxed by the function preamble; return
values are unboxed:

```cpp
int add(int a, Item item) { return a + item.id; }
```

```rust
pub fn add_0(a: i32, item: Item) -> i32 {
    let a: Value<i32> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(a));
    let item: Value<Item> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(item));
    return *a.borrow() + (*item.borrow()).id;
}
```

C++ passes arguments to functions by copy, so signatures stay unboxed; boxing
the copy on entry then lets the body treat parameters exactly like local
variables. The preamble skips reference parameters, which are a `Ptr<T>` and
never boxed.

Nested containers, library ones and arrays alike, box each level except the
innermost, so that every inner container can be borrowed and mutated on its own,
and a pointer can be taken to it. The boxing is written into the type rules
themselves: `std::vector<std::vector<int>>` maps to `Vec<Value<Vec<i32>>>`, and
the `carray` rules map `int a[2][2]` to `Box<[Value<Box<[i32]>>]>`, both before
the outer `Value<...>` of the declaration is added.

Struct fields are stored inline, so that a whole struct is a single allocation,
and a pointer to a field records the struct's allocation and the field's byte
offset (see [Pointers](pointers.md)). Arrays and vectors are the exception: an
array field is a `Value<Box<[T]>>` of its own, and a vector field a
`Value<Vec<T>>`. A pointer to an element, or to a field of an element, then has
the array or the vector as its allocation instead of the struct, and pointer
arithmetic moves between elements as for any other array:

```cpp
struct Holder { std::vector<Point> points; int n; };
h.points[0].y = 5;
```

```rust
pub struct Holder {
    #[offset(0)]
    pub points: Value<Vec<Point>>,
    #[offset(24)]
    pub n: i32,
}
(*(*h.borrow()).points.borrow_mut())[(0_usize) as usize].y = 5;
```

An array or vector field is accessed like a local one, through its own
`borrow()` or `borrow_mut()`, and the struct is only borrowed immutably to reach
it. As `Value` is shared on `clone()`, structs with such fields implement
`Clone` by copying the arrays and vectors, instead of deriving it.
